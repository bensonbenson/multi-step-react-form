# Multi Step Form using React/Material UI

This is a basic multi step React form where a user can enter data and traverse multiple pages of input without "changing" the webpage they are on. Going back will preserve their input.

Expanding upon/TO-DO: 

* Add a DB/Backend connection to save data
* Validate the data entered/make sure fields aren't blank

## Quick setup:

Clone the repository

Traverse to the directory of what you just cloned and run:

```
npm install
```

That should install the dependencies, then you can start the app with:

```
yarn start
```
